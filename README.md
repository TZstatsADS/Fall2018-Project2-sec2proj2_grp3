**Planning to open a restaurant in Manhattan?** 

**Our planner is the perfect way to find the best location to your restaurant? try our [app]( https://adsproj2group14.shinyapps.io/perfectplanner/)!** 

+ **Project summary**: 
One of the riskiest businesses to open nowadays is the restaurant business. According to a study conducted by the [Perry Group](https://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/average-life-span-restaurant-6024.html), most restaurants close within their first year. Moreover, private restaurants have much lower success rate than restaurant chains. One of the main reason for this failure is choosing the wrong location. Private restaurant owners lack the resources chains have to optimally choose the location of their restaurant. 
**Our app intends to fill this void and provide such resources to future restaurant owners.**

+ **How it works**: 
  Our app has two different features to help future restaurant owners:
  	+ **Map-it!**: 
	a visulization tool of different locations in Manhattan (by zip code) accompanied by location statistics relevant to the future owner's decision process indcluding the restaurant types and the demographic diversification in the area.
	+ **Find it!**:
	a location suggestion tool which allows the future owner to zone-in on all the areas which are ideal for his restaurant given a set of criterias: restaurant type, the minimal amount of people per this type of restaurants in the area and target clientele of the restaurant, such as socio-economic class and age. After an initial screening, the owner is given an overview of statistics about the suggested areas such as relative amount of restaurants of his type in the area, relative amount of people per this type of restaurants, accessibility, crime frequency, etc., and can rank the areas according to the the different statistic, to gain a full understanding of the pros and cons of each area and optimize his choice.

+ **Data Source**: 
 We rely on many data sources mainly collected from [NYC open data]( https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) and [U.S. government open data](https://data.gov/).
 
+ **Contribution statement**: 
We had a great experience working together on this project. We feel like the progress of our work was timely and efficient mainly due to great team work. We conducted many group meetings, brain stormed together on each functionality of our app and listened to every team member's thoughts. All team members were highly engaged in this project and conrtibuted equally.
